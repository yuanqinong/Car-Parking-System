# Car Parking System

This repository contains a Python project that utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect cars and license plates from video or image sources. The system uses the YOLOv8 object detection model for car detection and a custom license plate detection model, along with EasyOCR for optical character recognition (OCR) on the detected license plates.

## Features

- Detect cars in video or image sources using YOLOv8
- Detect license plates on detected cars using a custom model
- Perform OCR on the detected license plates using EasyOCR
- Support for both video and image input

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- EasyOCR
- Ultralytics (YOLOv8)
- filetype

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-parking-system.git
